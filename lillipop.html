<h1 class="heading">CHICKEN LOLLIPOP RECIPE</h1>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li>500 gm chicken</li>
<li>2 tablespoon coriander powder</li>
<li>4 tablespoon yoghurt (curd)</li>
<li>4 green chilli</li>
<li>4 tablespoon mustard oil</li>
<li>1 pinch red chilli powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
<li>1 tablespoon curry leaves</li>
<li>4 tablespoon tomato ketchup</li>
<li>salt as required</li>
</ul>
<h1>Process</h1>
<h4>Step1:Prepare the marinade</h4>
<p>
For the marination, take a bowl and mix chilli powder, coriander powder, 
turmeric powder, curd and salt together. This marination step 
is very important and will give this chicken recipe real flavour.
</p>
<h4>Step2:Marinate the chicken for 4-5 hours</h4>
Now, wash the chicken in cold running water and chop it. 
Once it is done, add the chicken pieces to the marinade. 
Once the chicken pieces are well-coated, keep them aside 
for 4-5 hours so that flavours are well absorbed. You can keep them in the refrigerator.
</p>
<h4>Step3:Shallow fry the marinated chicken</h4>
<p>
Now, take a deep-bottomed pan and heat oil in it over medium flame.
 Once the oil is sufficiently hot, carefully put the marinated 
 chicken pieces in the oil and shallow fry them till cooked or golden from both sides.
