<h1>Process</h1>
<ol>
<li>Take a fresh bowl and add 2 cups of Maida to it.</li>
<li>Add 1 tablespoon Sugar powder to the bowl.</li>
<li>Add ½ a tablespoon of salt to the mix.</li>
<li>Add 1 tablespoon of Oil to the bowl.</li>
<li>Mix the ingredients of the bowl well.</li>
<li>Add enough water so as to knead the flour into a dough.</li>
<li>Start kneading the dough.</li>
<li>Dough starts getting sticky.</li>
<li>Continue kneading the dough for another 10 minutes or more.</li>
<li>Prepare a soft dough.</li>
<li>Apply melted butter on the dough’s surface.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl with a lid and Let it rest for 1 hour.</li>
<li>When an hour has passed, uncover the bowl and check for fluffiness.</li>
<li>Knead it once again.</li>
<li>Knead it gently. If you find it troublesome to knead the dough in a bowl, 
you can also continue with the process on a surface.</li>
<li>Hence, prepare a super soft dough.</li>
<li>Cut the dough in pieces.</li>
<li>With these pieces of our super soft dough, make ball shaped moulds.</li>
<li>Our Dough balls are prepared. Place them in a bowl.</li>
<li>Again, apply butter over the dough and let it rest for another hour.</li>
<li>Now, let us start with cooking this dough into delicious Parotta.</li>
<li>Apply a thin layer of oil on a surface.</li>
<li>Place the super soft dough on this surface and press lightly.</li>
<li>Roll it gently with a roller for even results.</li>
<li>Roll it into a thin disc like shape.</li>
<li>Make cuts in the centre of this disc.</li>
<li>With these cuts as your reference, roll the rest of the dough into a thread-like structure.</li>
<li>Roll your rope together to form a spiral shape.
<li>Take another ball of our rested super soft dough and 
roll it into a thin sheet. Cut thin strips out of this sheet.</li>
<li>Bring these strips of dough close together.</li>
<li>Pull the concentrated strip slightly so as to stretch it.</li>
<li>Roll the strip into another spiral.</li>
<li>With your palm, slightly flatten this spiral.</li>
<li>Flatten it into a disc.</li>
<li>Prepare a hot tawa and set it on medium flame. Place your parotta disc on the tawa.</li>
<li>Add 1 tablespoon oil through its circumference.</li>
<li>Periodically flip over.</li>
<li>Press and cook the dough into a crispy delicious Parotta.</li>
<li>The tough turns brown to show preparedness.</li>
<li>Place your perfectly cooked Parotta for serving. Push it close to separate the layers.</li>
<li>Serve these gourmet crispy discs as a perfect side for any curry.</li>
